This incredibly vast number is derived from estimating both the number of galaxies in the observable universe and the average number of stars per galaxy.\\n\\nTo break this down further:\\n\\n1. Number of galaxies: Astronomers estimate there are about 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe[3][5].\\n\\n2. Stars per galaxy: While our Milky Way contains approximately 100-400 billion stars, this is not representative of all galaxies[1][3]. Many galaxies are smaller with fewer stars, while some are larger with more stars.\\n\\n3. Calculation: By multiplying the estimated number of galaxies by an average number of stars per galaxy, astronomers arrive at the 200 billion trillion figure.\\n\\nIt's important to note that this is an estimate for the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe we can theoretically see from Earth given the speed of light and the age of the universe. The actual number of stars in the entire universe could be much larger, potentially infinite if the universe extends beyond what we can observe[5].\\n\\nThis number is also subject to change as our understanding and observation techniques improve. For example, more sensitive telescopes may reveal fainter galaxies and stars, potentially increasing this estimate in the future[3].\\n\\nTo put this enormous number into perspective, it's often said that there are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth[2]. This comparison helps illustrate the truly mind-boggling scale of our universe.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), delta={'role': 'assistant', 'content': ''})], created=1739696913, model='sonar-pro', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=353, prompt_tokens=31, total_tokens=384, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None, citation_tokens=4877, num_search_queries=1), citations=['https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/How_many_stars_are_there_in_the_Universe', 'https://www.littlepassports.com/blog/space/how-many-stars-are-in-the-universe/', 'https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-resources/how-many-stars-are-there/', 'https://education.cosmosmagazine.com/how-many-stars-are-there-in-space/', 'https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/overestimated-stars-in-universe/', 'https://www.space.com/26078-how-many-stars-are-there.html', 'https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/'])\n",
